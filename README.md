# ASIF (Advanced Subtitle Improvements and Fixes)

## Introduction
ASIF is an attempt to create captions that are readable and accessible for people with disability (ADHD, ASD/Autism, etc.). This project uses [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) as an engine.

In fact, this project was made by an autistic person as a way to care about readability and accessibility.

## Note
This project was developed using AI-assisted programming tools (ChatGPT) to help with algorithm exploration, debugging, and code drafting. All architectural decisions, data processing logic, and validation were performed by the author.
